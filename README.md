There are different types of questions and a quiz has 11 general questions, 4 according to questions, 1 context questions, 1 in what book and chapter and 3 memory verse type questions (1 verse, 1 reference and 1 quote).

# Requirements
Run inside any modern IDE or using a compiler such as g++ as long as it is c++ 11 or later.
